lunar client command line launcher

this is very much a work in progress. <br>
the current product is very much intended for **my personal computer**.

roadmap:
 - agent injection
 - jre folder search / manual change
 - jvm args
 - ~~lunarlaunchwrapper adoption~~ (done in commit [#6514a2f](https://github.com/unethicalteam/lccll/commit/6514a2f8ddd79fce35dd0c7b9d569432176046d5))
